Organizations which sign up with the service can create their jobs site in a matter of a few minutes. It allows you to perform a full text search not only on the candidate's meta data but also inside the contents of the uploaded resume. It provides collaboration tools that help the HR managers and executives of an organization communicate more effectively with each other. It integrates with social networking sites like LinkedIn and Facebook. It allows candidates to apply with their LinkedIn account and provides the organization an approved view of the linked in profile including recommendations and extended profile data that is usually not available unless the candidate is already a part of your network. It also allows members of an organization to selectively publish the vacancy into their Facebook wall or a page they own.</p>

              <p>HighlightMagic is a tool to be used by individuals aspiring to be professional sportsmen. These budding athletes could record their game, upload the video, create highlights and share them with coaches who could then comment on highlight. Usually these videos are huge (1 - 1.5 Gigs). The client wanted a non-sucky way to upload these files. I implemented a resumable file upload. We used the HTML5 file to split the file into chunks and posted them to the Rails server. The Rails server transfers it to Amazon S3. The user could either close his laptop lid or lose his internet connection without affecting the upload. As long as the browser tab remains open we can resume the file upload. In the meanwhile if the file that is being uploaded is in the format that the browser supports (for e.g., H264 on Chrome) we instantly show the video and allow the user to create clips. This is done using the File API's CreateObjectURL and the ability of the HTML5 video player to play files based on these object URLs. The upload process happens in the background and once the upload is done, the video is transcoded, the thumbnails generated and the clips are cut from the transcoded video. The user can then share these clips with coaches who can then comment on it. The transcoder was built as an independent service and is hosted on Amazon EC2 (us-east-1) and can be independently scaled. The main app is hosted on Heroku to be in the same availability zone.</p>

                AuditionMagic allows casting agencies to manage their projects, roles, auditions, artist (talent) details and provides a collaborative environment for casting directors and reviewers to vote and comment on auditions for a given role. The members of the casting agency would upload videos and images of the auditions that took place. Videos were processed with zencoder to convert them to H264 MP4s. We used Rails 3.1, CoffeeScript and Backbone.js to build this as a single page app.

                Star Employee Intranet helped its employees to share information, photos and blog posts internally within the organization. I also built a document management system that allowed the users to version files. Once uploaded, the files were parsed via Apache POI / PDFBox and converted to text. Sphinx then built an index of the text within the document which allowed users to search within the document they had uploaded. It also featured the ability to control access on any of these resources on the basis of an individual user or to a group. This project was started when the company was establishing presence in several towns and smaller business districts in India. Setting up their private network was expensive and a long drawn process. That is when the company envisioned the intranet on the cloud.

                I was leading a team of developers. As a part of the business user tools initiative under SAP, we were commisioned to build a UI framework that could be used to build various business reports and analytics widgets on top of the Flex framework. We build the framework initially based on the open source
                <a href='http://sourceforge.net/adobe/cairngorm/wiki/About/'>Cairngorm 2 framework.</a>
                However we found that for large applications the size of the SWF was huge and the build times were quite large. We then evaluated the Polestar framework built by the Business Objects team and modified it to suit our requirements. The Polestar project implemented the Eclipse's platform and runtime libraries in Flex. I forked the project and added the ability to discover plugins and load plugins based on extension points and extensions. I also built a client side context framework that extended the AS3 Binding across different plugins (SWFs).

We achieved the complete functionality of setting breakpoints, inspecting locals and evaluating watch expressions using the Eclipse's default debug perspective.

I had built it in such a manner that the tool itself was really small. If an assembly placed in the same directory as the tool and it exposed classes conforming to an interface and is marked XMLSerializable, it would be dynamically loaded and any corresponding entries in the ".env" file could be processed. The results were tabulated using XSLT to present it as a nice HTML page that could be printed out. The tool also sported a IronPython plugin that could run any snippet of python code that could provide a similar result.

                SAP CRM Mobile Client in 4.0 was based on VBA and the 5.0 version was based on .NET. As a part of the team we were maintaining the 4.0 install package as it was already under SP4 when I joined however the work on 5.0 package was just beginning. The 4.0 installer took about 13 hours to build and was diffcult to service upgrades. I had rearchitected the 5.0 setup to do the following.
                <ul>
                  <li>Modularize the packages to achieve better serviceability.</li>
                  <li>Achieved over 60% reduction in size for frequently serviceable components like the client framework and controls.</li>
                  <li>Reduced effective build time from 8 hours to 40 minutes by making the setup build process as a part of the component build.</li>
                  <li>This enabled us to peform more Develop-Test-Fix cycles increasing the overall quality of the product</li>
                  <li>Adopted a "Release early, Release often" approach to enable quicker bug fix cycles. Instead of performing all the quality validation using the QM team, basic smoke tests were done and the Installation package was released to the application developers for internal use.</li>

          <p>I have always been very passionate about open source software. My first PC was a 486 DX2 with 3.5" floppy drives. I ran Slackware on it which came with PC Quest magazine on 6 floppies. It was fun installing and nuking my hard disk in that process. Since then, I've been participating in the community and contributing what I can in terms of code, documentation, discussions, etc. Here are some of the projects that I am proud of.</p>
          <h3>
            <a href='https://github.com/dharanasoft/quartz-jruby'>quartz-jruby</a>
          </h3>
          <p>Quartz is an open source Java based scheduling framework. This project provides a JRuby wrapper over the cron API. The API is meant to be readable and really simple to create cron jobs in the java process space.</p>
          <h3>
            <a href='https://github.com/dharanasoft/haml-sprockets'>haml-sprockets</a>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Rails 3.1 uses sprockets for its asset pipeline. Rails 3.1 has shown considerable love for SCSS and SASS but has left HAML out. We at Dharana Software Innovations are die hard HAML fans. We beleive that it is the best templating language around. So we would like to have it as a part of our client side toolkit as well. The haml-js project does exactly that. It was written for Node.js but works well with the browser too. This project helps us build JST templates with hamljs.
          </p>

          </h3>
          <p>
            This plugin is used to syntax highlight pieces of code to RTF and it automatically copies it to the OSX clipboard. This will be very useful in putting code into keynote presentations.

          <h3>Ryan Schilling (A DharanaSoft Client) - CEO, GoNeighborly</h3>
          <p>
            This is my second startup and I've worked with no less than a half dozen development firms and probably two dozen engineers/designers.  You are by far the most well informed and talented hacker I've worked with.  I would say that it is not only your ability to code or speed or any of the normal measurements most developers get graded on that sets you apart.  Having lived in San Francisco and known startup founders and engineers, I see clearly that your talent is both being able to clearly understand the vision and build innovative solutions.  Most importantly you have a tremendous feel for product function/features.  I have not seen this in any of the people I've worked with.

          <p>
            The first thing that amazed me about Vagmi was his ability to talk at length on any topic, especially technical, on the fly. The friendly, approachable nature makes it a pleasure interacting with this knowledge bank. I've seen him as a very diligent worker, keen on learning new things and more importantly sharing and applying them at work whenever possible. I'm sure he will be an invaluable resource in any organization or team.

          <p>
            Vagmi is a hard core technical person who knows in &amp; out of all the open source technologies. He has a passion to explore in depth in all the technology aspects, showed faster growth from an engineer to become a team lead in shorter period of time when I worked with him in Slashsupport.

            Vagmi - A gem who had too much knowledge and capability whom I could see growing in to more than where was then.
